# Project-Euler

On some evenings I'm in the mood to solve a small problem or rather puzzle within a well defined scope. I pour myself a dram of Scotch and code away. I call that _recreational programming_. [ðŸ¥ƒ #BallmerPeak #XKCD323](https://xkcd.com/323/)

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Why Ruby? ðŸ’Ž
I have a soft spot in my heart for functional languages. I always wanted to learn Ruby because I adore its syntax und I thought this would be a neat way to learn it step by step. A public project like this also offers me the opportunity to revisit older problems and refactor them. It would also be a nice way to practice some unit testing with Ruby.


## Why Github? Why Public?
The more I work with Git the more I realise that you only learn it by messing things up. Then, when you are stuck in a problem, you solve it and learned some new aspect. The more you use it, the better you get. Simple as that.

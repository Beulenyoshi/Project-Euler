Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

class Fixnum
=begin
Extension of Fixnum class so that we can easily depict digit count.

    if (self > 0) then
      Math.log10(self).to_i + 1

=begin
Returns Boolean if n is a palindrome. n will be converted to string.

Assuming that odd numbered inputs are a palindrome as long as they are mirrored / symmetrical

Since we are searching for the highest number, we will improve our search by
walking down backwards and stepwise. Therefore we set up an upper- / lower-bound and
iterate through the products.
